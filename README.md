# Maze_hasn
This is a project for Data Structure and Algorithm course in IIUM which is written by Java 
The user input the maze size, then program generate it randomly and give the user the ability 
To choose one of the three algorithm to solve it. The algorithms are DFS, BFS, and DFS without recursion.
Finally the program print true if the maze is solvable and false if it's unsolvable.
